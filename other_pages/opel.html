<p>Adam Opel AG  is a German automobile manufacturer, subsidiary of the French automotive company Groupe <strong>PSA</strong> since <strong>March 2017</strong> after being bought by <strong>General Motors in 1929</strong>. Opel's headquarters are based in <strong>Rüsselsheim</strong>, Hesse, Germany. The company <em>designs, engineers, manufactures, and distributes </em>Opel-branded <em>passenger vehicles, light commercial vehicles, and vehicle parts</em> for distribution in Africa, Asia, Europe, and South America. Opel designed and manufactured vehicles are also sold under the <strong>Buick brand</strong> in the <em>United States, Canada, Mexico, and China</em>, the <strong>Holden</strong> brand in <em>Australia and New Zealand</em>, and the <strong>Vauxhall brand</strong> in <em>Great Britain</em>.</p>

<p>Opel traces its roots to a sewing machine manufacturer founded by <strong>Adam Opel in 1862</strong>. The company began manufacturing <strong>bicycles in 1886</strong> and produced its <strong>first automobile in 1899</strong>. </p>
<p>Opel became a share-limited company (German: <em>Aktiengesellschaft</em>) in <strong>1929</strong>; General Motors took a majority stake in Opel that same year. General Motors assumed full control in <strong>1931</strong>, and today Adam Opel AG is a wholly owned subsidiary of <strong>General Motors Company</strong>. Although Adam Opel AG continues to be a share-limited company, shares of the company are not publicly listed. Adam Opel AG is the parent company of <strong>General Motors UK Limited</strong>, better known as <strong>Vauxhall</strong>, and various other General Motors subsidiaries. </p>
<p>During the <strong>1970s and 1980s</strong>, the Opel and Vauxhall ranges were rationalised into one consistent range across Europe.</p>

<p>Opel withdrew from <strong>China</strong>, where it had a network of <strong>22 dealers</strong>, in early <strong>2015</strong> after General Motors decided to withdraw its <strong>Chevrolet</strong> brand from Europe starting in <strong>2016</strong>.</p>

<h2>Company</h2>
<p>Opel operates 10 vehicle, powertrain, and component plants and four development and test centers in six countries, and employs around 35,000 people in Europe. The brand sells vehicles in more than 50 markets worldwide. Other plants are in Eisenach and Kaiserslautern, Germany; Szentgotthárd, Hungary; Zaragoza, Spain; Gliwice, and Tychy, Poland; Saint Petersburg, Russia; Ellesmere Port, and Luton, UK. The Dudenhofen Test Center is located near the company's headquarters and is responsible for all technical testing and vehicle validations.</p>
<p>Around 6,250 people are responsible for the engineering and design of Opel/Vauxhall vehicles at the International Technical Development Center and European Design Center in Rüsselsheim. All in all, Opel plays an important role in the global GM corporate group. The company was responsible for primary engineering of the Epsilon (I) platform, Epsilon II platform, Delta (I) platform, Delta (II) platform, and Gamma platform, and played an important role in the development of especially the higher-end, more-refined version of the Gamma II platform. General Motors' new global platform D2xx is being mainly engineered by Opel, as well.</p>
<p>Opel is in most cases fully responsible for the car architectures and technologies up to the Opel Insignia/Buick Regal. In particular, many of the future-oriented, modern, fuel-efficient GM architectures for compact vehicles are developed by Opel.</p>
<p>Even the idea and concept behind the Ampera was rooted in Opel with Frank Weber, the former Global Vehicle Line Executive and Global Chief Engineer electric vehicle development, being originally an Opel employee who was moved to the United States to advance the development of this concept in GM's home country instead of the German outpost that is Opel. In 2009, Weber returned during the reorganization of the Opel leadership to Adam Opel GmbH as Vice President Planning and Commercial Vehicle Operations for the company. In 2011, Frank Weber left Opel for BMW.</p>
<p>Opel established the Opel Performance Center in 1997, which is responsible for the development of high-performance cars such as the Astra OPC, Corsa OPC, and Insignia OPC. The OPC name is also used in some motorsport activities.</p>
<p>Opel Special Vehicles (OSV) is a wholly owned subsidiary that offers public authority and special-purpose vehicles. OSV developed in cooperation with the International Technical Development Center the Opel Zafira B 1.6 CNG (compressed natural gas).</p>
<p>Opel Group GmbH is responsible for the operation of General Motors businesses in Europe.</p>
<h2>World presence</h2>
<p>Opel is the main brand of General Motors in Europe. As of 2014, the Opel brand was present in the most of Europe, in parts of North Africa, in South Africa, the Middle East, in Chile and in Singapore. Their models have been rebadged and sold in other countries and continents, such as Vauxhall in the United Kingdom, Chevrolet in Latin America, Holden in Australia and New Zealand, and previously, Saturn in the United States and Canada. Following the demise of General Motors Corporation's Saturn division in North America, Opel cars are currently rebadged and sold in the United States, Canada, Mexico, and China under the Buick name with models such as the Opel Insignia/Buick Regal, Opel Astra sedan/Buick Verano(both which share underpinnings with the Chevrolet Cruze), and Opel Mokka/Buick Encore.</p>

  <h2>History</h2>
  <p>The company was founded in Rüsselsheim, Hessen, Germany, on <strong>January 21, 1862</strong>, by <strong>Adam Opel</strong>. At the beginning, Opel just produced sewing machines in a cowshed in Rüsselsheim. Above all, his success was based on his perfectly customized <em>sewing machines</em>. Because of the quick growth of his business, in <strong>1888</strong>, the production was relocated from the cowshed to a more spacious building in Rüsselsheim. Encouraged by success, Adam Opel launched a new product in <strong>1886</strong>: He began to sell high-wheel bicycles, also known as <strong><em>penny-farthings</em></strong>. Besides, Opel's two sons participated in high-wheel <em>bicycle races</em>, thus promoting this means of transportation. Therefore, the production of high-wheel bicycles soon exceeded the production of <em>sewing machines</em>. At the time of Opel's death in <strong>1895</strong>, he was the leader in both markets.</p>
  <p>The first cars were produced in <strong>1899</strong> after Opel's sons entered into a partnership with <strong>Friedrich Lutzmann</strong>, a locksmith at the court in <strong>Dessau</strong> in Saxony-Anhalt, who had been working on automobile designs for some time. These cars were not very successful and so the partnership was dissolved after two years, following which Opel's sons signed a licensing agreement in 1901 with the French Automobiles Darracq France to manufacture vehicles under the brand name "Opel Darracq". These cars were made up of Opel bodies mounted on Darracq chassis, powered by two-cylinder engines.</p>
  <p>The company first showed cars of its own design at the <strong>1902</strong> Hamburg Motor Show, and started manufacturing them in <strong>1906</strong>, with <strong>Opel Darracq</strong> production being discontinued in <strong>1907</strong>.</p>
  <p>In <strong>1909</strong>, the Opel <strong>4/8 PS model</strong>, known as the <strong>Doktorwagen ("Doctor's Car")</strong> was produced. Its reliability and robustness were greatly appreciated by physicians, who drove a lot to see their patients, back when hard-surfaced roads were still rare. The Doktorwagen sold for only <strong>3,950</strong> marks, about half as much as the luxury models of its day. </p>
  <p>In <strong>1911</strong>, the company's factory was virtually destroyed by fire and a new one was built with more up-to-date machinery.</p>
  <h2>Logo</h2>
  <p>The first Opel logo contained the letters "A" and "O" – the initials of the company's founder, Adam Opel. The A was in bronze, the O kept in red.</p>

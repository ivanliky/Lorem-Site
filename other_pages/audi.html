<h1>Audi</h1>
<p><img src="images/Audi.png" width="350" height="217" alt=""/></p>
<p>Audi  is a German automobile manufacturer that designs, engineers, produces, markets and distributes luxury vehicles. Audi is a member of the <strong>Volkswagen Group</strong> and has its roots at <em>Ingolstadt</em>, Bavaria, Germany. Audi-branded vehicles are produced in <em>nine</em> production facilities worldwide.</p>

<p>The origins of the company are complex, going back to the early <strong>20th</strong> century and the initial enterprises <em>(Horch and the Audiwerke)</em> founded by engineer <strong><em>August Horch</em></strong>; and two other manufacturers <strong><em>(DKW and Wanderer)</em></strong>, leading to the foundation of Auto Union in <strong>1932</strong>. The modern era of Audi essentially began in the <strong>1960s</strong> when Auto Union was acquired by Volkswagen from <strong>Daimler-Benz</strong>. After relaunching the Audi brand with the 1965 introduction of the Audi <strong><em>F103</em></strong> series, Volkswagen merged Auto Union with <em>NSU Motorenwerke</em> in <strong>1969</strong>, thus creating the present day form of the company.</p>

<p>The company name is based on the Latin translation of the surname of the founder, <strong><em>August Horch</em></strong>. <em>"Horch"</em>, meaning <em>"listen"</em> in German, becomes <em>"audi"</em> in Latin. The <em>four rings</em> of the Audi logo each represent one of four car companies that banded together to create Audi's predecessor company, <em>Auto Union</em>. Audi's slogan is <strong><em>Vorsprung durch Technik</em></strong>, meaning <strong><em>"Advancement through Technology"</em></strong>. However, since <strong>2007</strong> Audi USA has used the slogan <strong><em>"Truth in Engineering"</em></strong>. Audi, along with BMW and Mercedes are among the best-selling luxury automobile brands in the world.</p>
<h3><span id="Modern_era">Modern era</span></h3>
<p>The new merged company was incorporated on 1 January 1969 and was known as <strong>Audi NSU Auto Union AG</strong>, with its headquarters based at NSU's Neckarsulm plant, and saw the emergence of Audi as a separate brand for the first time since the pre-war era. Volkswagen introduced the Audi brand to the United States for the 1970 model year. That same year, the mid-sized car that NSU had been working on, the K70, originally intended to slot between the rear-engined Prinz models and the futuristic NSU Ro 80, was instead launched as a Volkswagen.</p>
<p>After the launch of the Audi 100 of 1968, the Audi 80/Fox (which formed the basis for the 1973 Volkswagen Passat) followed in 1972 and the Audi 50 (later rebadged as the Volkswagen Polo) in 1974. The Audi 50 was a seminal design because it was the first incarnation of the Golf/Polo concept, one that led to a hugely successful world car. Ultimately, the Audi 80 and 100 (progenitors of the A4 and A6, respectively) became the company's biggest sellers, whilst little investment was made in the fading NSU range; the Prinz models were dropped in 1973 whilst the fatally flawed NSU Ro80 went out of production in 1977, spelling the effective end of the NSU brand. Production of the Audi 100 had been steadily moved from Ingolstadt to Neckarsulm as the 1970s had progressed, any by the appearance of the second generation C2 version in 1976, all production was now at the former NSU plant. Neckarsulm from that point onward would produce Audi's higher end models.</p>
<p>The Audi image at this time was a conservative one, and so, a proposal from chassis engineer Jörg Bensinger[26] was accepted to develop the four-wheel drive technology in Volkswagen's Iltis military vehicle for an Audi performance car and rally racing car. The performance car, introduced in 1980, was named the Audi Quattro, a turbocharged coupé which was also the first German large-scale production vehicle to feature permanent all-wheel drive through a centre differential. Commonly referred to as the Ur-Quattro (the Ur- prefix is a German augmentative used, in this case, to mean original and is also applied to the first generation of Audi's S4 and S6 Sport Saloons, as in UrS4 and UrS6), few of these vehicles were produced (all hand-built by a single team), but the model was a great success in rallying. Prominent wins proved the viability of all-wheel drive racecars, and the Audi name became associated with advances in automotive technology.</p>
<p>In 1985, with the Auto Union and NSU brands effectively dead, the company's official name was now shortened to simply<strong> Audi AG</strong>. At the same time the company's headquarters moved back to Ingolstadt and two new wholly owned subsidiaries; Auto Union GmbH and NSU GmbH, were formed to own and manage the historical trademarks and intellectual property of the original constituent companies (the exception being Horch, which had been retained by Daimler-Benz after the VW takeover), and to operate Audi's heritage operations.</p>
<p>In 1986, as the Passat-based Audi 80 was beginning to develop a kind of grandfather's car image, the type 89 was introduced. This completely new development sold extremely well. However, its modern and dynamic exterior belied the low performance of its base engine, and its base package was quite spartan (even the passenger-side mirror was an option.) In 1987, Audi put forward a new and very elegant Audi 90, which had a much superior set of standard features. In the early 1990s, sales began to slump for the Audi 80 series, and some basic construction problems started to surface In the early part of the 21st century, Audi set forth on a German racetrack to claim and maintain several world records, such as top speed endurance. This effort was in-line with the company's heritage from the 1930s racing era Silver Arrows.</p>
<p>Through the early 1990s, Audi began to shift its target market upscale to compete against German automakers Mercedes-Benz and BMW. This began with the release of the Audi V8 in 1990. It was essentially a new engine fitted to the Audi 100/200, but with noticeable bodywork differences. Most obvious was the new grille that was now incorporated in the bonnet.</p>
<p>By 1991, Audi had the four-cylinder Audi 80, the 5-cylinder Audi 90 and Audi 100, the turbocharged Audi 200 and the Audi V8. There was also a coupe version of the 80/90 with both 4- and 5-cylinder engines.</p>

<h2>History</h2>

<p>Originally in <strong>1885</strong>, automobile company <strong><em>Wanderer</em></strong> was established, later becoming a branch of <strong>Audi AG</strong>. Another company, <strong>NSU</strong>, which also later merged into Audi, was founded during this time, and later supplied the chassis for <em>Gottlieb Daimler's</em> four-wheeler. </p>
<p>On <em>14 November 1899</em>, August Horch <em>(1868–1951)</em> established the company A. <strong><em>Horch &amp; Cie</em></strong>. in the <em>Ehrenfeld district</em> of Cologne. Three years later in <strong>1902</strong> he moved with his company to <em>Reichenbach</em> im Vogtland. On <em>May, 10th, 1904</em> he founded the <em>August Horch &amp; Cie</em>. <strong>Motorwagenwerke AG</strong>, a joint-stock company in <em>Zwickau</em> (State of Saxony).</p>

<p>After troubles with Horch chief financial officer, August Horch left Motorwagenwerke and founded in Zwickau on <em>16 July 1909</em>, his second company, <strong><em>the August Horch Automobilwerke GmbH</em></strong>. His former partners sued him for trademark infringement. The German <em>Reichsgericht</em> (Supreme Court) in Leipzig, eventually determined that the Horch brand belonged to his former company.</p>

<p>Since August Horch was prohibited from using <em>"Horch"</em> as a trade name in his new car business, he called a meeting with close business friends, Paul and <em>Franz Fikentscher</em> from Zwickau, Germany. At the apartment of Franz Fikentscher, they discussed how to come up with a new name for the company. During this meeting, Franz's son was quietly studying Latin in a corner of the room. Several times he looked like he was on the verge of saying something but would just swallow his words and continue working, until he finally blurted out, <em>"Father – audiatur et altera pars... wouldn't it be a good idea to call it audi instead of horch?"</em> <em><strong>"Horch!"</strong></em> in German means <em>"Hark!"</em> or <em>"hear"</em>, which is "Audi" in the singular imperative form of <em>"audire"</em> – <em>"to listen"</em> – in Latin. The idea was enthusiastically accepted by everyone attending the meeting. On 25 April 1910 the Audi Automobilwerke GmbH Zwickau (from 1915 on Audiwerke AG Zwickau) was entered in the company's register of Zwickau registration court.</p>

<p>The first Audi automobile, the <strong>Audi Type A 10/22 hp</strong> (16 kW) Sport-Phaeton, was produced in the same year, followed by the successor <strong>Type B 10/28PS</strong> in the same year.</p>

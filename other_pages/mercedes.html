  <h3>Car nomenclature</h3>
  <p>Until 1994, Mercedes-Benz utilized an alphanumeric system for   categorizing their vehicles, consisting of a number sequence   approximately equal to the engine's displacement in liters multiplied by   100, followed by an arrangement of alphabetical suffixes indicating   body style and engine type.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>"C" indicates a coupe or cabriolet body style (for example, the CL   and CLK models, though the C-Class is an exception, since it is also   available as a sedan or station wagon).</li>
    <li>"D" indicates the vehicle is equipped with a diesel engine.</li>
    <li>"E" (for "Einspritzung") indicates the vehicle's engine is equipped with petrolfuel injection. In most cases (the 600 limousine and Mercedes E-Class being the exceptions), if neither "E" or   "D" is present, the vehicle has a petrol engine with a carburettor.</li>
    <li>"G" was originally used for the Geländewagen off-road vehicle, but is now applied to Mercedes SUVs in general (for example, the GLA and GLK).</li>
    <li>"K" was used in the 1930s, indicating a supercharger ("Kompressor")   equipped engine. Two exceptions : the SSK and CLK, where K indicates   "Kurz" (short-wheelbase).</li>
    <li>"L" indicates "Leicht" (lightweight) for sporting models, and "Lang" (long-wheelbase) for sedan models.</li>
    <li>"R" indicates "Rennen" (racing), used for racing cars (for example, the 300SLR).</li>
    <li>"S" Sonderklasse "Special class" for flagship models, including the S-Class, and the SL-Class, SLR McLaren and SLS sportscars.</li>
    <li>"T" indicates "Touring" and an estate (or station wagon) body style.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Some models in the 1950s also had lower-case letters (b, c, and d) to   indicate specific trim levels. For other models, the numeric part of   the designation does not match the engine displacement. This was done to   show the model's position in the model range independent of   displacement or in the price matrix. For these vehicles, the actual   displacement in liters is suffixed to the model designation. An   exception was the 190-class with the numeric designation of "190" as to denote its entry level in   the model along with the displacement label on the right side of the   boot (190E 2.3 for 2.3-litre 4-cylinder petrol motor, 190D 2.5 for   2.5-litre 5-cylinder diesel motor, and so forth). Some older models   (such as the SS and SSK) did not have a number as part of the   designation at all.</p>
  <p>For the 1994 model year, Mercedes-Benz revised the naming system. Models   were divided into "classes" denoted by an arrangement of up to three   letters (see "Current model range" above), followed by a three-digit (or   two-digit for AMG models, with the number approximately equal to the   displacement in litres multiplied by 10) number related to the engine   displacement as before. Variants of the same model such as an estate   version or a vehicle with a diesel engine are no longer given a separate   letter. The SLR, SLS and GT supercars do not carry a numerical   designation.</p>
  <p>Today, many numerical designations no longer reflect the engine's actual   displacement but more of the relative performance and marketing   position. Despite its engine displacement in two litres, the powerplant   in the A45 AMG produces 355 brake horsepower so the designation is   higher as to indicate the greater performance. Another example is the   E250 CGI having greater performance than the E200 CGI due to the   different engine tuning even though both have 1.8-litre engines. From   the marketing perspective, E200 seems more "upscale" than E180. Recent   AMG models use the "63" designation (in honor of the 1960s 6.3-litre M100 engine) despite being equipped with either a 6.2-litre (M156), a 5.5-litre (M157) or even a 4.0-litre engine.</p>

  <h2>History</h2>
  <p>Mercedes-Benz traces its origins to Karl Benz's creation of the <em>first petrol-powered car</em>, the Benz Patent Motorwagen, financed by <strong>Bertha Benz</strong> and patented in <strong>January 1886</strong>, and <strong>Gottlieb Daimler</strong> and engineer <strong>Wilhelm Maybach's</strong> conversion of a stagecoach by the addition of a petrol engine later that year. The Mercedes automobile was first marketed in <strong>1901</strong> by <em>Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft</em>. <strong>(Daimler Motors Corporation)</strong>. <strong>Emil Jellinek</strong>, an Austrian automobile entrepreneur who worked with <strong>DMG</strong> created the trademark in <strong>1902</strong>, naming the <em>1901 Mercedes 35 hp</em> after his daughter <strong>Mercedes Jellinek</strong>. The first Mercedes-Benz brand name vehicles were produced in <strong>1926</strong>, following the merger of Karl Benz's and Gottlieb Daimler's companies into the <strong>Daimler-Benz</strong> company. On <strong>28 June 1926</strong>, Mercedes Benz was formed with the merger of Karl Benz and Gottlieb Daimler's two companies.</p>
  <p>Gottlieb Daimler was born on <strong>17 March 1834</strong> in <strong>Schorndorf</strong>. After training as a gunsmith and working in France, he attended the <em>Polytechnic School</em> in Stuttgart from 1857 to 1859. After completing various technical activities in France and England, he started work as a <em>draftsman</em> in Geislingen in 1862. At the end of 1863, he was appointed <em>workshop inspector</em> in a machine tool factory in Reutlingen, where he met Wilhelm Maybach in <strong>1865</strong>.</p>
  <p>Throughout the <strong>1930s</strong>, Mercedes-Benz produced the <strong>770</strong> model, a car that was popular during Germany's Nazi period. <strong>Adolf Hitler</strong> was known to have driven these cars during his time in power, with bulletproof windshields. Most of the surviving models have been sold at auctions to private buyers. One of them is currently on display at the <strong>War Museum in Ottawa</strong>, Ontario. The pontiff's <strong>Popemobile</strong> has often been sourced from Mercedes-Benz. In <strong>1944, 46,000</strong> forced laborers were used in Daimler-Benz's factories to bolster Nazi war efforts. The company later paid <strong>$12 million</strong> in reparations to the laborers' families. Mercedes-Benz has introduced many technological and safety innovations that later became common in other vehicles. Mercedes-Benz is one of the best-known and established automotive brands in the world </p>
